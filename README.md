# ToDo App 📝

This is a full-stack ToDo application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
It allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** tasks — providing a seamless and responsive experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js with Axios for API calls and modern UI design
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose) for data storage
